## Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables to manage API keys securely:

- `.env` - Default environment variables (commited to git, contains a test API key)
- `.env.local` - Local environment variables (not commited to git, your personal settings)

To use your own API key, create or edit `.env.local` file:

```
# Required: Caiyun Weather API Key
NEXT_PUBLIC_CAIYUN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Optional: Analytics ID for umami analytics
# NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID=your_analytics_id

# Optional: Analytics Script URL for custom analytics service
# NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_SCRIPT_URL=https://your-analytics-domain.com/script.js
```

## CORS Handling

The application includes a built-in API proxy to handle CORS issues with the Caiyun Weather API. This proxy is automatically used when making API requests, so you don't need to worry about CORS errors in the browser.

## Deployment

You can deploy this application to any hosting service that supports Next.js:

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (Recommended)
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
- Any server that can run Node.js

## API Key

The default uses a test key. For long-term use, please register a [Caiyun Weather developer account](https://platform.caiyunapp.com/) to get your own API key, and add it to your `.env.local` file as described in the Environment Variables section.
